<h3> Hello! My name is Paola Jareno, but most people call me Lola. I am currently an undergraduate 
student at the University of Georgia. I am going to tell you a bit about my past, since it is 
quiet different than most of the other students that attend this University.
<p>

I was born on the beautiful Carribean Island of Puerto Rico. The capital of Puerto Rico, San Juan, will always hold a special place in my heart
because it was where I took my first breathe of fresh air in this beautiful life. I grew up half of my life on the beach 
in this beautiful paradise. Spanish is my first language due to spending my childhood years here. In the table below, I have
listed the different cities that I have lived in during my 19 years of life. I will write a small summary for each place I have lived in.
<table border="5" > <style="float: right">
<tr> <td> Orocovis, PR </td> </tr>
<tr> <td> Kissimmee, FL </tr> </td>
<tr> <td> Deltona, FL </td> </tr>
<tr> <td> Marietta, GA </td> </tr>
<tr> <td> Valdosta, GA </td> </tr>
<tr> <td> Athens, GA </td> </tr> 
</table> </p>

<h3> Puerto Rico </h3>
<p><img src="puertorico.jpg" alt="Puerto Rico" style="float:right" width="400" height="400">
<font face="verdana" size="3" color="white" </font> My house in Puerto Rico had no air-conditioning. It was never needed, because
I lived in the mountains of the island, so the elvation kept the town climate feeling cool. Even when it got very hot, the island always had a nice breeze that would 
make it seem not as hot. I would wake up in the morning to smell of coffee all throughout the house. My grandma would get out of
bed early to make sure that everyone had coffee prepared for them by the time they woke up. She even had a small tea cup
for me that she would add a little coffee with lots of milk, and of course, lots of sugar. She would make sure my mother had no idea
of the sugar part.
<br> </br>
Everyone in this town knew eachother. It was a very different environment to any other place I have ever lived in. Everybody
cared for eachother as much as they cared for themselves. Sometimes I do miss this environment, but it is very hard to imagine myself
living there today, just because of how different I have grown up and my interests today.

<h3> Florida </h3>
<p><img src="florida.jpg" alt="Florida" style="float:left" width="360" height="200"> <font face="verdana" size="3" color="white" </font> 
My first days in the United States were spent in the sunshine state. I was very accustomed to my way of living in a spanish speaking country, 
and moving into a different lifestyle like this was very difficult for me at first. I was in the third grade when my parents put me in a 
public school. This was already different, since I went to a Catholic private school where I lived before. I had trouble 
communicating with my classmates at school, which led me to hating having to attend school. My parents had to drop me off at school crying multiple times, which sounds terrible,
but they knew it was what was best for me at the time. I picked up the English language very quick this way since I had no other 
choice. 
<br> </br> By the time I reached fifth grade, I was top in my class in school, which is surprising seeing as all of these
other kids had been speaking the english language since they were babies, and I had only been around it for about two years. These were the most interesting school years 
of my life.

<h3> Georgia </h3>
<p><img src="valdosta.jpg" alt="Georgia" style="float:right" width="400" height="250"> <font face="verdana" size="3" color="white" </font> 
Most of my life has been spent in the beautiful state of Georgia! I have lived in the northwest, southwest, and now towards the northeast in Athens.
I would have to say that my favorite city that I have lived at in this state is Valdosta. There is something about the south that I absolute adore. The weather
is on average warmer than the north, which is a big plus for me considering I cannot stand cold weather.  This must be because of my warm Puerto Rican blood.
Valdosta also had very heart-warming people. The people from there are very welcoming, compared to the people living closer to the city. I have found that they are a bit less friendly
than the people living in smaller towns. I have only been living in Athens since the beginning of the school year, and I am very excited to see what the 
classic city has instore for me, along with the university of my dreams: The University of Georgia. To the right of this text is an image showing a small pond in the city of Valdosta during beautiful spring weather.
